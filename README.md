# Web Design @cmda-minor-web 19/20

This repository contains the documentation and code for the prototype of an application to open and view excel-files in your browser. This application is exclusively designed for our test subject who suffers from Macula Degeneration(MD).
By building this application, I'm hoping to make it easier for him to view data from excel files.

More information on `exclusive design`, our test subject, my research and the process of building this application can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/lennartdeknikker/web-design-1920/wiki) for this repository.
